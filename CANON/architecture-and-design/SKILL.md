# Architecture And Design

## Overview

Design the seam before the diff.

**Core principle:** if the seam, contract, current-state evidence, required support files, or trade-off is implicit, the design is not ready.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance the architectural target is still unstable, you ABSOLUTELY MUST finish the design record before implementation begins.

IF ARCHITECTURE APPLIES TO THE REQUEST, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

<HARD-GATE>
Do not route to implementation while the public seam, replacement boundary, dependency direction, rollback shape, or verification shape are still implicit.

Do not let implementation discover contract edge cases.
Do not leave observability or rollback generic.
Do not claim the architecture is "obvious" to skip alternatives.
</HARD-GATE>

<NON-NEGOTIABLE>
Every run must declare its exact local `assets/` and `references/` set before execution, read the required files before making the decision, and record why each declared file was loaded.
Unnamed support files are out of contract and must not be relied on.
If no support files are needed, say `none` explicitly. Final outputs must report the declared set, the files actually read, and the files actually used.
</NON-NEGOTIABLE>

<NON-NEGOTIABLE>
Record current-state evidence, target-state framing, migration path, rollback plan, observability baseline, and the recommended next owner.
</NON-NEGOTIABLE>

<ANTI-PATTERN>
Do not present architecture as stack preference, code proximity, or taste.
</ANTI-PATTERN>

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP: you're rationalizing.

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The architecture is obvious" | If the trade-off matters, alternatives must still be named and rejected. |
| "Implementation can discover the contract edges" | That is a design miss, not implementation work. |
| "Generic logging and rollback notes are enough" | Generic notes are not a baseline. Name boundary, owner, signal, and trigger. |
| "I declared the reference files, so that's enough" | Declared is not read. Read is not used. Record all three. |
| "Current-state evidence can just be intuition" | Evidence must be named, not implied. |
| "We can tighten dependency direction later" | Hidden dependency direction becomes hidden coupling. |
| "Rollback will be easy because the change is small" | Small changes can still have large blast radius. Write the rollback shape. |
| "I do not need a reference because I know this area" | Required references exist to prevent stale recall and shallow design. |

## Required Reads

- You MUST start from `assets/design-note.md` before proceeding.
- You MUST read `assets/architecture-review-checklist.md` before finalizing the design note.
- You MUST read the relevant reference before proceeding:
  - `references/service-decomposition.md` when split versus merge is the main decision
  - `references/platform-contracts.md` when shared contract or host ownership changes
  - `references/ai-routing-guardrails.md` when autonomy, cost, retry, or fallback rules matter
  - `references/observability-and-reliability-baseline.md` when rollback or runtime evidence shapes the design

## When to Use

- IF module_split OR contract_change OR adapter_choice IS unsettled THEN USE
- IF UX_structure AND technical_structure MUST align before build THEN USE
- IF reliability OR security OR rollback shape changes with the design THEN USE

## Do Not Use

- IF request_is_raw_intake THEN ROUTE -> intake-and-routing
- IF work_is_routine_implementation_with_no_structural_choice THEN ROUTE -> implementation-backend OR implementation-frontend
- IF work_is_release_or_runtime_triage THEN ROUTE -> release-and-operations

## Procedure

```text
1. DECLARE(support_files := exact assets/ + references/ set OR none)
2. READ(required_assets_and_references_before_deciding)
3. RECORD(why_each_declared_file_was_loaded)
4. LOAD(seam, evidence, constraints, consumers, runtime_risks)
5. STOP("stabilize the architectural target first") IF seam_is_not_stable OR contract_is_implicit
6. RECORD(current_state_evidence := seam_behavior + coupling_or_bottleneck_evidence + dependency_or_metric_evidence)
7. NAME(target_seam := module_boundary OR public_api OR data_contract OR page_flow OR release_gate)
8. COMPARE(at_least_two_shapes) AND RECORD(why_losing_options_lost_now)
9. CHECK(contract_ownership, dependency_direction, observability_and_rollback, security_exposure, downstream_consumers, host_or_manifest_seams, execution_model_compatibility)
10. APPLY_GUARDRAILS(cost_cap, timeout, retry, fallback, shadow_mode, promotion_grading) IF autonomy_or_high_cost_runtime_path = TRUE
11. RECORD_PLANES(control_plane, execution_plane, prompt_policy_plane, permission_plane) IF runtime_is_interactive OR agent_driven
12. RECORD_BRIDGE(direct_call OR command_bridge OR message_bridge) IF runtime_is_interactive OR agent_driven
13. DEFINE(migration := first_increment + coexistence_or_cutover + rollback_trigger + rollback_owner)
14. ROUTE ->
  implementation-frontend IF seam_is_client_facing
  implementation-backend IF seam_is_backend_or_contract_facing
  planning-and-scoping IF execution_boundary_is_not_yet_operable
15. STOP("design note is ready for the next owner")
